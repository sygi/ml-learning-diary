done: 5.07.2015

Paper discusses using spectral (calculating eigenvectors) method on clustering and classifying documents. The base of the algorithm is the affinity matrix describing similarity of items (e.g. the cosine similarity of word vectors), which is later split using svd and calculations on biggest k values are used.
