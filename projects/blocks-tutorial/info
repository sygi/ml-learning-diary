1. the sources of a datastream are matched with variable names
2. you have to use separate DataStream for monitoring (or use TrainingDataMonitoring)
3. you cannot have a source unused in a dataset
4. if you have cost and weights = nan, it means you didn't initialized the weights
5. to use TrainingDataMonitoring, one must add after_epoch=True

questions:
1. how to monitor two variables that have the same name?
2. how to rename data source?
3. is that (substituting in computation graph) the correct way of using a trained network?
